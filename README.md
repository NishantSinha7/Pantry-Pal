# Pantry-Pal
App that suggest recipes from your pantry items.
It's my first app in swift playground, which i made for the Swift student challenge 2024
The initial idea of app was to make it capture photo of food items in your pantry and it will suggest you the recipes you can make from those itms.
In this app since i have to submit smething which is totally internet free i manually intigrated an item list from which user can mke the selection of items which they have and app will suggest what type of recipes they can make from them with detailted step by step process.
The futhure scope of app is to make it for cross selection from which user can mix match new items whatever they have and can discover new recipes which make them eat entairly new and healthy food.
